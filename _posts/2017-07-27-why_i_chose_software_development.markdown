I have always been analytical and a deep thinker.  Just like most people, I've always found it important to try to understand the world around me.  Questions I've pondered were: Why are we here?  What does it all mean?  What purpose does my life serve? What is the higher power behind it all?  One thing I've come to realize is life is a journey...and my life has led me to coding.

When I was a teenager I had a fascination with game development as a likely career prospect.  The high cost for the schooling and the arduos education required intimidated me at the time so I put the notion of being a game programmer out of my mind.  Also, I didn't possess the cognitive tools to know how to solve daily life problems.  That was about to change.

Fast forward many years later as I chose higher learning to fulfill my intellectual and spiritual needs through college.  My serious venture into college came by a person I admired who gave me two college textbooks to start my college path:  Mass Communications and Logic and Critical Thinking.  The concepts intrigued me in those books.  Mass communications is the idea of spreading media, whether letters, billboards, or presidential campaigns, to be disseminated to a large group of people.  Logic and critical thinking is the philosophy of using rational thought processes to evaluate our own thoughts and the thoughts of others and test those thoughts for inaccuracies.  If it wasn't for these books, I don't think I would have found my aha! moment and my life would have taken a very different turn.  Logic and critical thinking was a completely new idea to me, it became my Biblical manna.  My prior religious convictions, that being Christianity, was challenged as well as my thoughts, and I decided to incorporate this new philosophy as a replacement religion to Christianity.  These two college subjects were parallel to the idea of computer programming.

I assimilated these concepts of mass communication and logic and critical thinking into the ideal career field: computer programming.  The internet is the best tool to-date that deals with the distribution of information and computers only understand one language, that being--you guessed it--logic and critical thinking!  Of course, computers don't have critical reasoning abilities such as intuition like humans but they follow algorithms very well.  You can say that we are programmed from birth until we die to have a permutation of algorithms that we call on to perform tasks at different stages of life.  Intuition can also be an algorithm in this sense.  Because of this marriage between my favorite subjects and my deep love for learning, I instantly gravitated towards computers, narrowing my interests down further to software engineering.

So now studying the art of computer programming keeps me balanced by sharpening my problem-solving skills and using the discipline of sound logical reasoning to keep my program free from bugs, both within my mind and within my computer programs.  There is no other career field I would find more fulfillment in and that is why I chose software development.
