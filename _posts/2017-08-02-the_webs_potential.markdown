The Web has lots of potential as a medium to communicate with millions of people.  Unfortunately, it is where the laissez faire ideology is exercised in its extreme.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  It's a curse because you can find every vile thing uploaded into its information board, such as malware and sinister solicitors posing as benign actors; it's a blessing because you have a more transparent view of the world we live in and the amount of information available is simply staggering.  Understanding this hidden world brought to life by the computer screen is what drives me to learn everything I can about it.  It is just so fascinating!  What I find clear to me but it seems subtle to lots of other people is the realization that the Web is society's eyes and ears.  We get to finally receive a glimpse of what it's like to be like a god: an omniscient and omnipresent being that is constantly evolving.  Technology is constantly evolving, for instance, as more developers and technology experts find better ways to do things and then have society adopt those practices afterwards.  The Web is omniscient because it seems whatever thought we have that we think is unique, chances are we can find somewhere on the Web where that thought was already converted into digital data.  Of course, the ubiquitous of the Web and it's portrayal of every facet of human existence makes it omnipresent.  Imagine if society lived in a time period without the Web, to lovers of technology this would feel like the dark ages!

It's important to understand the role the Web plays in todays world.  Thanks to the availability of smart phones and other Web-ready gadgets, the world is at our fingertips.  Navigating through the Web and finding the right information requested is vitally important to the users who take for granted the power the Web envokes.  What the Web is teaching us is how to convert seemingly useless data into meaningful information we can rely on and so we can grow to new productive heights.  The Web is our resource for a wealth of information and data that we can shape to alter the condition of our digital universe into whatever niche we happen to have a fancy for.  Again, why is this important?  It's our chance to experience the godhead revered by the world's religions.  This may seem like hubris, but it is what any ambitious person secretly strives for, that is, to alter their environment so that it grants them the most benefit.

In our modern society, we are completely desensitized to the hardships we would face if we didn't have all these luxuries and conveniences brought about through technology.  We act as those these things are always supposed to be here, as if smart phones always existed and the cavemen were using them during the Ice Age to snap chat and send cat videos to each other during long winter nights holed up in their ice caves.  ![](https://liveto110.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Livin-the-caveman-Lifestyle.jpg)The truth is, we don't know what to do without the Web.  We can't live without it.  I think this all goes back to that saying, "if you can't beat'em, join'em," meaning that the Web is not going away anytime soon so we might as well uncover its potential by exploring the interface that draws you into a portal of untapped mystery that begs to be explored.
