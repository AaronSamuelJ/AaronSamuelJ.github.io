# **<p style="text-align: center;"> Object Architecture </p>**
Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.

A procedural language is a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures within its programming context to compose a program. It contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a computational task or program.

In procedural programming, the language treats functions as separate entities, while in object orientation the methods, although similar to functions, are linked with an object.

Using the metaphorical approach, programmers can represent real life models of things and instantiate them in code, which will be converted to binary digits of ones and zeros.

In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

In a scholarly article dug up from the University of Minnesota's archives, programs are buillt from a world of vitualization: "the dual nature of software is a direct result of computer scienceâ€™s unique status as, on
the  one  hand,  being  the  creator  of  its  own  subject  matter,  which  it  shares  with  a  kettle
artisan,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  operating  in  an  abstract  domain  with  relaxed  physical
constraints, which it shares with mathematicians."

The idea of metaphors bringing understanding to abstract concepts is nothing new.  In any language, words are simply symbols that, when used, are simple associations of external, tangible, and metaphysical concepts.  The image below shows abstraction between an actual house, the domain model used to represent it programmatically, and a hard disk that stores the program.

Great coders are esteemed as famous artists who compose magnum opuses and enrich the culture that makes use of their work.  The cryptic symbols known as code are to coders what the Mona Lisa is to art connoisseurs.  This appreciation for art underlies a lot of Western philosophy as embodied by Michalangelo in The Creation of Adam.  The basic premise has to do with striving towards the highest ideal and the ideal state is a godlike figure.

And like God, programmers are intent to create things that never existed before.  Object orientation tries to bridge the gap between the physical world and the world of the virtual.
Object Structure:
<ol><li>Classes bring concepts into existence and manufacture individuals from its definitions.</li>
<li>Objects are the individual items instantiated into being, derived from the class definition.</li> 
<li>Methods are the actions performed by either the objects or the class itself.</li>
</ol>
Using this approach, it is not hard to apply the theory of object orientation and build a system that solves a problem through code.  Objects interact with other objects, and they perform operations based on messages.  For example, if a person, who comprises an element of the Person class, decides to drive a car, he or she will receive the message from the brain "drive the car."  Then the person will interact with the other object, a car that comprises an element of the Car class, and they will collaborate to perform work together.  The person will perform the method "drive" while the car performs another method "be_driven" that will move the car.
One message is from the car object to be driven and the other message is from the person to "drive the car," and through this relationship a problem is solved: get from point A to point B.

So object orientation deals with using an approach to problem solving(through code) by  using metaphors and the techniques of abstraction to model real world concepts and convert them into  ones and zeros that the computer registers and allows the ideas to develop expectantly.  The computer is also representative of a test of physics that vets the programmers' ideas and disgards the ideas/programs that don't honor the rigor of physics in the virtual environment, that is supposed to be an abstraction to the physical world.  This idea of vetting the best ideas is what was found by Charles Darwin in the study of the natural environment between organisms that compete together to live in a hostile environment, which is the real/tangible world.
